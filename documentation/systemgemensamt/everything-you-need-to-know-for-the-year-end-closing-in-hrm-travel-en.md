(Only Norwegian companies)
New rates for mileage allowance for Norwegian companies has not been published yet. Read more at

NB!
The Norwegian Tax Administration’s website has not been updated, and the applicable rates are 5.3 and 1.8.
The government rate for mileage allowance, as stated in the
Norwegian Government Travel Regulations
, is NOK 5.30 per kilometer. The difference between the two rates means that, in practice, you are taxed on the last NOK 1.80 you receive per kilometer.
